# asyncio_basics

Asyncio is a Python library that provides support for concurrent code execution using coroutines, event loops, and asynchronous I/O. It's particularly useful for handling I/O-bound operations, such as networking tasks or working with external APIs, without blocking the entire program.

Let's go through the basics of asyncio to help you become more proficient:

## 1. Understanding Asyncio Basics:
Coroutines:
Asyncio heavily relies on coroutines, which are special types of functions defined with async def instead of just def.
Coroutines are functions that can be paused and resumed, allowing other tasks to run in the meantime.
async/await Syntax:
The async keyword is used to define an asynchronous function, and await is used to pause execution until the awaited coroutine is complete.

```bash
async def example_coroutine():
    print("Start coroutine")
    await asyncio.sleep(2)
    print("End coroutine")

# Run coroutine
asyncio.run(example_coroutine())
```

## 2. Event Loop:
The event loop is the central execution point for an asyncio program.
It manages the execution of coroutines and tasks.
Creating an Event Loop:

```bash
import asyncio
asyncio def main():
    #your asynchronous code here

# Run the envent loop
asyncio.run(main())
```

## 3. Tasks:
Tasks are used to schedule coroutines for execution in the event loop.
Creating Tasks:

```bash
import asyncio
async def my_coroutine():
    # your asynchronous code here

# Create a task
task = asyncio.create_task(my_coroutine())
```

## 4. Asynchronous I/O:
Asyncio is particularly useful for I/O-bound operations, such as network requests or file I/O.
Example with asyncio.gather():

```bash
import asyncio

async def fetch_data(url):
    # Your async code to fetch data from url here
    print('url:',url)

async def main():
    urls = ['url1', 'url2', 'url3']
    tasks = [fetch_data(url) for url in urls]
    await asyncio.gather(*tasks)

asyncio.run(main())
```

## 5. Handling Exceptions:
Exception handling in asyncio involves using try and except blocks.

```bash
import asyncio

async def example_coroutine():
    try:
        # Your async code here
        syswww()
    except Exception as e:
        print(f'An error occured: {e}')

asyncio.run(example_coroutine())
```

## 6. Timeouts:
You can set timeouts for coroutines using asyncio.wait_for().

```bash
import asyncio

async def my_coroutine():
    # Your coroutine code here

try:
    asyncio.wait_for(my_coroutine(), timeout=5.0)
except asyncio.TimeoutError:
    print('Timeout occured')
```

## 7. Concurrency with asyncio.gather() and asyncio.create_task():
You can run multiple coroutines concurrently.
